### What project are you building 

Tenzorum is focused in building a complete end-to-end onboarding kit for the decentralized web, to empower the developer community to build friendly and familiar applications using Blockchain Technology and give users a secure portal to the web 3.0.

### Why did you decide to build it 

Our decision comes from the fact that the onboarding experience for applications using Blockchain is completely broken. If we are talking about mass consumer adoption and hitting the mainstream with decentralized technology, it is naive to assume that people will interface with the complexity of our current systems to simply start using an application.

If our main priority as a community isn‚Äôt to build friendly technology that empowers people, we are going in the wrong direction.

We believe that creating this system where new users don‚Äôt have to go after ETH and the insane KYC process to execute simple on-chain functions or send randomly acquired ERC20s, can liberate the growth and potential of the Ethereum community and all applications.


### How long will it take 

6 Months

### How much funding are you requesting  

$200,000

### How did you hear about the GEF

Met Stefan, Gnosis CTO at DEVCON and found a lot of synergies in our vision. üèÑ

## Your Proposal 
### Project description

####Project elements:
1. A connection application called MetaConnect that leverages and displays all the elements being built to showcase the potential of meta transactions (Relayed tx) being built as a progressive web-app, where users are interactively onboarded and deploy a Gnosis Safe as part of after the process. We see the integration of Gnosis Safe as an integral piece of web3 security, particularly with recovery configuration and the ability to remove trusted party recovery methods. 

2. An open SDK to allow developers to seamlessly deploy and use:
  
      a. Ephemeral Keys - Key that are used and get discarded or replaced with a stable key in the process of applicaiotn onboarding
  
      b. A personal multi-sig (GNOSIS SAFE) - A wallet contract that connects between the various devices users interact with and serves as the stable keychain for users' relevant longer term assets holding as well as access recovery.
  
      c. Personal ENS Domains (TENZ-ID) - a 1 click ENS subdomain factory that allows users, programs and developers to interact with human readable Ethereum addresses. The initial mainnet implementation can be found on [tenzorum.org/tenz_id](tenzorum.org/tenz_id) .
  
      d. Meta-Transactions (Relayers) - Transaction that are signed off-chain and are relayed to the network via a proxy node that pays the gas fees.    
  
3. Tenzorum Service Node Network - A decentralized relayer network to support meta-transactions with token rewards connected to DutchX as a liquidity provider. An initial test implementation currently runs in single node mode. Research of the cryptoeconomic models to expand and build a relayer node network in order to create a market for a permissionless layer 2 economies.


TO EXPLORE RESEARCH AND COLLABORATION:
1. Private Transactions using relayers and Tenzorum SDK with Zero-Knowledge transactions.
2. Social Recovery to complement the personal Gnosis Safe Multisig.


### Features

- EIP 1077 implementation - Universal Logins + Relayer Network

- Gnosis Safe integration into Tenzorum SDK + Universal Logins SDK

- User will be able to deploy a gnosis safe from MetaConnect app.

- Developers will be able to integrate Gnosis Safe into their applications easily.

- Relayers will be able to convert the rewarded tokens using DutchX.

- All the work and achievements will be broadcasted as tutorials and development guides.

### Timeline, Milestones and Deliverables

#### Phase I
To deploy and interact with GNOSIS SAFE from Tenzorum SDK.
Perform all the wallet operations - Checking balances, sending ETH, sending Tokens, etc.
User experience work guaranteeing that developers can seamless explore all the functionalities of the SAFE and other Tenzorum functions.
To integrate GNOSIS SAFE into Meta-Connect as a second stage of interaction after a user is already onboarded into the application i.e. continuous exposure of Gnosis product to Tenzorum current and future audience.

#### Phase II
Deploy the network of relayers with the following features:
Seamless meta-transaction from Tenzorum SDK.
Permissionless and easy deployment of relayers.
Meta-transactions fee payable in tokens or ETH.
Backend integration with DutchX to allow relayers to convert their fee tokens.
